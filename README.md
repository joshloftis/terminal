# Personal Website

This repo holds the React application for my personal website. There are two main parts: the MainApp and the Home experience. The MainApp is a terminal-like experience built in React. The Home app is a typical webpage with basic information.

Ovetime, I plan to add more to the overall buildout to both the MainApp and the Home app. For example, there are certain command line games I'd like to explore to add, as well as other typical terminal experiences that could be fun to build. For the Home app I'd like to add at least a blog.

Feel to pull this down and play with it yourself.

```
git clone git@github.com:joshloftis/terminal.git
```

### Getting started

### Deploying

I have a pipeline with Zeit's Now tool that allows this React site to be built and deployed with commits to master. Check out the now.json set up, and look into Zeit and their tool Now to set up something similar.
